The plot above shows the relationship between math proficiency and expenditure for schools in New York State. Each dot represents a school's combination of test performance and expenditure per pupil. The schools are divided into two groups based on the level of economic disadvantage of the students at the schools. The blue dots indicate schools for which 80% of their test-takers were classified as economically disadvantaged.
